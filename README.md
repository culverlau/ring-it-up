- *Amplify* is the Javascript library provided by AWS to easily use the services in your client application. It also provides a CLI to get set up and configure settings.
- *AppSync* is a service provided by AWS. It is a GraphQL serverside API and can be connected to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authenticated API requests.
- *DynamoDB* is a service provided by AWS. It is a DocumentDB in JSON format which automatically is generated by Amplify when you create a GraphQL API model. This is where the GraphQL data is stored.
- *CRUD* is short for “Create, Read, Update, Delete” which often is the minimum requirement for your API, to perform these on the database.
- *GraphQL* is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn’t tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
